# REQ-0001-GOAL-COUNT-SYSTEM-RESETS: Count system resets reliably

## Round 1

### Customer requirements

Goal: Count system resets reliably.

Problem:
The SCR system running image v8.26.0 experiences resets and sometimes enters reset loops as docs/MONIT.md describes. First step is a new low-level system reset counter providing a base for future reset-loop detection.

In scope:
- System reset detection mechanism.

Out of scope:
- Reset-loop detection and mitigation.

Tasks:
- Review image contents.
- Analyze kernel capabilities.
- Provide system reset counting mechanism relying only on low-level primitives: i.MX6 CPU registers and kernel subsystems.
- Implement according to notes; ask follow-up questions where needed.

Required behavior and constraints:
- Must not rely on user-space services such as monit or any other service; use only i.MX6 CPU registers and kernel subsystems.
- Log resets using atomic file functions under /var/log/scr/reset-<UTC timestamp in milliseconds>.
- After each reset, create a new reset-XXXX file under /var/log/scr/ and write reset reason into it.
- Perform file creation first, then reason write as a distinct second step, so at least reset signal survives if reason write cannot complete.
